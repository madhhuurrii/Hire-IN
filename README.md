# HireIN
HireIN is an application developed using HTML, CSS, Nodejs, Expressjs, MongoDB and will be
hosted by Heruko. It is an opportunity and job portal to host recruitment opportunities for
employers as well as expose students to various opportunities available. Through our portal, we
encourage more transparency within the hiring process thus bridging the gap between employers
and students together. The portal focuses on various channels of recruitment like LinkedIn,
Hackathons, Careers page etc and make it accessible for students.HireIN provides a system that
helps technical recruiters manage the process more efficiently.

# Motivation
In the mid of the covid pandemic, every work went into the online process. In such a situation,
the Internships provided by the Internship Coordinator are more important for students for the
experience of working with startups and good companies. As it becomes difficult for the
Internship Coordinator to keep a record of all Internships and also for students finding the
internship opportunities between WhatsApp messages which is a bit distorted. Even after this
pandemic will be over, the same problem will arise. Hence, a new platform needs to be
constructed for the convenience of both the Coordinator and students. And this platform can
provide study materials, blogs from experienced ones and about Hackathons too. And provide
them to apply to Internships and Hackathons through LinkedIn.
